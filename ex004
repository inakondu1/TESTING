when i rely on AI for designs, i will find it difficult to "defend," the project i claimed that i did. i will also lack the indept knowledge needed to answer a question or defend the project.

I can not beat my chest that i can fix the bug without AI but i will definately make an attempt on it.

3 I will atempt, go on resarch, and listen to podcast, youtube videos that are related to the topic.

4 though, i still uses AI a bit more than fairly but when i get to that point which will be soon. Using AI fairly today will help me to put my brain to work, my thinking capabilities will be changed, it amazing how i will sit to read questions instead of coping it and pasting it to chat gbt or gemini to answer. I know develop the habit of understanding the questions and atempting to solve the question. once i begane to use AI fairy i will be able to attempt realy word challenges with pride.

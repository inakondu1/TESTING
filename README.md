# TESTING


A short summary of what you learned about AI and self-reliance.

AI is a powefull tools for learning. it has the ability of breaking dowm things to a laymans language. it is fast but at times it can be wrong expecially if not properly prompt.

Self relaince, relying on myself ususally brings out the best in me. once it is somthing that i have learnt i can confidently defend it. Now, i understand why some function are used not just coping and pasting.
Your main insight about using AI ethically as a coder.

using ai as a coder has being helpful. i use AI as an amplifire which has giving me an indept knowledge in coding. Ai helps me to understand how, but i took my time to know why. after the strugles and strugles withou getting it, i make us of AI to accelerate my thinking and knowledge.
One paragraph describing how you plan to apply these principles in future quests.

 In future coding challenges, I plan to treat AI as a consultant.  I will write the initial logic myself to establish a foundation, use AI to have a better view or to check if i am missing edge cases, input the new ideas into the code to ensure I can explain every decision to a peer or any person. i want to be keeping my human intuition at the center of the digital craft.

Objective: Define your personal rules for ethical AI use in learning.

Create a markdown file fairness_contract.md with three sections:

I will use AI when:

I have tried solving a problem myself by atempting it for about 30 to an hour without getting it right.

I need to understand why something works, the fuctions, loops, etc in other to have more understanding in my project 

I want to explore alternative approaches to getting the project done.

I will NOT use AI when:

I haven't tried the problem on my own by attempting to solve it.

I am completing an exam or assessment because it is not right and i am decieving myself.

I am still learning fundamental concepts which are necessary for my programme and skills.

I know I'm using AI fairly when:

I can explain my code without AI's help or having the taught of using it.

I could solve a similar problem independently over and over again


I feel more confident in my own understanding and be able to use different approches.

Sign and date your contract. Isah Ina febuary 12, 2026
